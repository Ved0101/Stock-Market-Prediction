# Stock-Market-Prediction
This is my project on Stock Market Target  Prediction
The first column is the company. The following are the age, market, date (separated by year, month, day, hour, minute), share volume, various traditional prices of that share (close, open, highâ€¦), some price and volume statistics and target.
The target is mainly defined as 1 when the closing price increases by at least 5% in 5 days (open market days). The target is 0 in any other case.
